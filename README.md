Lauren Jenkins, Missouri Botanical Garden, NSF Research Experience for Post-Baccalaureate Students

this repository contains the working material for generating ecological niche models for the genus Fraxinus in the eastern US, with the ultimate goal of comparing ENM output to a pollen density model in their ability to predict climate tracking of trees since the last glacial maximum (LGM, 21 KYBP).

research conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Adam B. Smith of the Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis, MO.
